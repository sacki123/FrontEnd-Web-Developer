                                <u>The Fibonacci strategy</u>
                            </b>
                            is a popular method used in trading, particularly in technical analysis. 
                            It is based on the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on). 
                            In trading, Fibonacci retracement levels are used to identify potential support and resistance levels on a price chart.

                            "It's worth noting that Fibonacci retracement levels are not always effective. 
                            Their effectiveness also depends on the market timeframe and the product you are trading. 
                            Combining various indicators and other technical analysis tools is crucial."

                             is a market analysis method based on changes in investor psychology during trading. 
                            Invented by Ralph Nelson Elliott, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that the market is formed by impulse waves and corrective waves.
